# ContactManager
This is a project for COP 4331 (Processes of Object-Oriented Software Development) hosted at http://cop4331group2.com

It is a simple contact manager that allows a registered user to create, read (search), update, and delete contacts.

Contacts have a first and last name, email, phone number, and a date the contact was created.

The project is hosted remotely and will use a LAMP (Linux, Appache, MySQL, PHP) stack.

The developers on this project are Istiaqul Alam (Frontend), Monica Castro-Suarez (API), Joseph Finfrock (Project Manager), Allen Lin (Database), Marieclaire Reyes (API), and Ashton Williams (Frontend).
