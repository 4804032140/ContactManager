# ContactManager
This is a project for COP 4331 (Processes of Object-Oriented Software Development)
It is a simple contact manager that allows a registered user to create, read (search), update, and delete contacts.
Contacts should atleast have a name (prefer first and last name), email, phone number, and a date the contact was created.
The Project will be hosted remotely and will use a LAMP (Linux, Appache, MySQL, PHP) stack.
The developers on this project are Istiaqul Alam, Monica Castro-Suarez, Joseph Finfrock, Allen Lin, Marieclaire Reyes, and Ashton Williams.
